## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Integration

- Direct Supabase client usage
- Row-level security compliance
- Efficient batch operations
- Real-time data fetching

### State Management

- Form validation and error handling
- Loading states and user feedback
- Optimistic UI updates

### Styling Consistency

- Matches existing `exams.tsx` patterns
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations
- Dark/light theme ready

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Requirements

Ensure these tables exist in your Supabase database:

- `notifications` (with proper structure)
- `profiles` (for user information)
- `course_enrollments` (for course targeting)
- `attendance` (for lecture absence targeting)
- `exam_attendances` (for exam absence targeting)
- `push_tokens` (for push notifications)

### 2. File Installation

Copy these files to your project:

```
app/(admin-tabs)/admin_notifications.tsx
components/NotificationForm.tsx
components/RecipientSelector.tsx
components/PreviewCard.tsx
services/push-notifications.ts
```

### 3. Navigation Update

Update `app/(admin-tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new tab (already done in provided file).

### 4. Push Notification Setup (Optional)

1. Deploy the Edge Function: `supabase functions deploy send-push`
2. Set environment variables:
   - `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `FCM_SERVER_KEY` (if using FCM)

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Notification

```typescript
// Send a simple info notification to all students
const notification = {
  title: 'System Maintenance',
  body: 'The system will be under maintenance tonight from 11 PM to 1 AM.',
  type: 'info',
  targetType: 'all_students',
};
```

### Course-Specific Alert

```typescript
// Alert all Computer Science students about exam
const notification = {
  title: 'CS101 Exam Reminder',
  body: 'Your Computer Science exam is tomorrow at 10 AM in Hall A.',
  type: 'warning',
  targetType: 'course_students',
  targetId: 'cs101-course-id',
};
```

### Absence Follow-up

```typescript
// Follow up with students who missed a lecture
const notification = {
  title: 'Missed Lecture',
  body: "You missed today's Physics lecture. Please check the recording.",
  type: 'warning',
  targetType: 'lecture_absentees',
  targetId: 'physics-lecture-id',
};
```
