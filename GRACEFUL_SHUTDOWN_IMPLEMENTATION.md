# Graceful Shutdown & Connection Cleanup Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides proper cleanup of all realtime connections during logout for both admin and student users.

## Components Added/Modified

### 1. Connection Cleanup Service (`services/connection-cleanup.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Centralized management of all Supabase realtime subscriptions
- **Features**:
  - Tracks active subscriptions by channel name
  - Force cleanup all connections on logout
  - Status monitoring and logging
  - Singleton pattern to ensure single instance

### 2. Enhanced AuthContext (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

- **Modified**: `logout()` function
- **Features**:
  - Graceful shutdown sequence
  - Connection status logging before cleanup
  - Emergency cleanup fallback
  - Proper error handling with guaranteed state cleanup

### 3. Enhanced useNotifications Hook (`hooks/useNotifications.ts`)

- **Added**: Connection tracking and cleanup functions
- **Features**:
  - Registers subscription with cleanup service
  - Unique channel names per user to avoid conflicts
  - Automatic cleanup on user change/logout
  - Added `cleanup()` function for manual cleanup

### 4. Enhanced GlobalNotificationContext (`contexts/GlobalNotificationContext.tsx`)

- **Modified**: Subscription management
- **Features**:
  - Registers popup subscription with cleanup service
  - Separate channel for popup notifications
  - Automatic cleanup on user change/logout

## Logout Sequence

1. **Log connection status** - Shows active connections before cleanup
2. **Clear UI state** - Immediately update auth state to prevent UI issues
3. **Clean up connections** - Remove all Supabase realtime subscriptions
4. **Sign out from Supabase** - Complete the authentication logout
5. **Error handling** - Emergency cleanup if any step fails

## Benefits

- **No more "max subscribers reached" errors**
- **Proper connection cleanup** - No lingering connections
- **Real-time updates** - Bell icons and notifications update instantly
- **Graceful degradation** - System works even if cleanup fails
- **Debug logging** - Easy to track connection issues

## Usage

The cleanup is automatic and happens during normal logout flow. No additional code needed in components that use notifications.

## Testing

To verify the implementation works:

1. Log in as any user type (admin/student/teacher)
2. Check console for subscription setup messages
3. Send notifications and verify real-time updates
4. Log out and check console for cleanup messages
5. Log back in - should have clean slate with no subscription conflicts
