## Modified Files

### 1. `/app/_layout.tsx`

- Updated navigation routes to include new login pages
- Changed default redirect to `/login-selection` instead of `/login`

### 2. Updated all logout redirects

### 3. `/app/login.tsx` → `/app/login-original.tsx`

## Testing

- Development server starts successfully
- TypeScript compilation passes for new files

## Next Steps

3. Update any documentation or user guides
4. Consider adding additional role-specific features to each login page

## Benefits
